Background
-----------
Created the form for Texas Certified Development Company, Inc.
The purpose of the form was to aid in determining if an applicant
met the "small business concern" to be eligible for an SBA loan.
In past affiliate forms a loan officer had to manually create rows and led
To the creation of Excel spreadsheets with different styles and formats by loan officers.
The form sets a standard format and makes it easy to add or remove affiliates.
